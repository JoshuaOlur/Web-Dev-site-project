                    <h2>Striped burrfish</h2>
                    <p>The Striped burrfish exhibits prominent features such as large heads and widely spaced bulging eyes. Their body coloration tends towards brown with prominent dark patches. Sporting golden-yellow eyes accented with iridescent blue-green speckles in the pupils, they possess a distinctive appearance. Covered in short, rigid spines that remain upright at all times, unlike their relatives, the porcupinefish, which have flexible spines. Their locomotion involves undulating or waving their pectoral fins and tails rather than flexing their entire bodies. In situations of threat, Striped burrfish, like other members of the burrfish and pufferfish families, have the ability to inflate their bodies by ingesting water.</p>

                    <h2>Batfish</h2>
                    <p>Batfish belong to the anglerfish family and possess a unique adaptation: a "fishing pole" topped with a fleshy "bait" used to attract prey within striking distance. This specialized structure is situated above their small mouth and, unlike other anglerfish, can retract into a recess when not actively in use.</p>

                    <h2>Turbot</h2>
                    <p>The turbot, esteemed for its culinary qualities, inhabits sandy and gravelly coastal areas. This flatfish typically has its eyes positioned on the left side of its head, characteristic of left-sided flatfish species. While lacking scales, its head and body are adorned with numerous bony knobs, known as tubercles. Turbots can grow up to a maximum length of 1 meter.</p>

                    <h2>Flashlight Fish</h2>
                    <p>Flashlight fish belong to the family Anomalopidae, comprising three species within the Beryciformes order. These fishes are distinguished by luminescent organs located just below their eyes. They represent a rare instance among non-deep-sea fish species possessing such organs.</p>
